# IT ACADEMY LLETRES REPETIDES

## Getting started 🚀
Show by console how many times each letter of your name and surname appears with different variants (phases).

#### LEVEL :one:

```Exercice 1```

- Create an array with your name where each position corresponds to a letter.
- Loop this array and console each of the letters.

```Exercice 2```

In the loop, if the letter is a vowel, print on the console: ‘I found the VOWEL: __’. Otherwise, print: ‘I found the CONSONANT: __’.
If you find a number, display: ‘People’s names do not contain the number: __’


```Exercice 3```

Store the letters of the array and the number of times they appear on a Map.

```Exercice 4```

- Create another array with your last name where each position corresponds to a letter.
- Merge the two arrays into one. Also, add a position with an empty space between the first and second. That is, we start from 'array name and surname' and at the end of the execution we will only have one called fullName.
